# SCIP-2022

This repository contains an R notebook with code for plotting OTU counts of a set of microbial communities, as well as an example plot and two data files for practice. The associated tutorial video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0VGRc99qV8

Both data files are in zipped form - they will need to be extracted prior to use.
