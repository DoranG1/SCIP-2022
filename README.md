# SCIP-2022

This repository contains an R notebook with code for plotting OTU counts of a set of microbial communities, as well as an example plot and two data files for practice. The associated tutorial video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0VGRc99qV8

Note that due to GitHub file sizing limitations, the data file is different from what is shown in the video:
 - The number of source communities has been reduced from 4 to 2 (this means there are only 18 total unique communities in the data)
 - The taxonomic information on the OTUs has been removed. 
All the code should work the same as in the video, and the example plot in the repository is what should be outputted by the current code.

Due to the sizing limits there is no additional file with a "replicate" variable as mentioned in the video, but there are instructions in the code for creating this data frame in R if you would like to plot with replicates.
